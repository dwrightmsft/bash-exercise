# bash-exercise
This repo contains a single bash script used as part of a learning exercise, and as such contains intentional errors.

The script performs the following:

- Obtains the user's location details from an open API (GeoIP)
- Passes latitude and longitude to a open weather API to return a forecast for the user's location
